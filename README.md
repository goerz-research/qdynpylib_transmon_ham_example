# Generating a QDYN runfolder for a system of two transmons

This repository contains an example for how to generate a runfolder (config file
and input data) for propagation of a two-qubit transmon system using QDYN. This
requires the development branch version of
[`qdynpylib`](https://github.com/goerz/qdynpylib), the development branch
version of [`QNET`](https://github.com/mabuchilab/QNET), as well as a recent
version of [`QuTiP`](http://qutip.org).

It is highly recommended to use install these packages into the [Anaconda Python
Distribution](https://anaconda.org).

[See the notebook `Generating a QDYN runfolder for a system of two transmons.ipynb`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/goerz/qdynpylib_transmon_ham_example/blob/master/Generating%20a%20QDYN%20runfolder%20for%20a%20system%20of%20two%20transmons.ipynb)
for the example.
